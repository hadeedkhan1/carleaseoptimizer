Calculates the most and least expensive down payment to monthly payment cost breakdown over the course of your lease. Based off of Rivian and Tesla's lease model but applicable to all EVs. Encorporates 7500$ credit in lease cost the way manufacturers calculate it. For non-EVs, please see normal version.
